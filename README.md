# Hate and Stereotypes prediction inside tweeets using Neural Network

This Python project uses a neural network to predict the presence of hate and stereotypes in tweets. The model is trained on a dataset of tweets that have been labeled as either containing hate speech or not, as well as a dataset of tweets that have been labeled as containing stereotypes or not.
